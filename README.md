# Scope
Lightweight utility program to mute programs that aren't in focus. Written in Python using tkinter. Originally made ot mute valorant on lost focus, this program is generalized to work with basically any windows application. This was made for my personal use so there likely won't be a ton of support in the future, but if someone asked me to I'd be willing to change/add a feature.
